  Good designs are not about fancy tricks and cutting-edge technology or
  trendy fads. It is all about communication and building brand integrity. I can build   
  you a webpage that uses layout, colors, fonts and imagery as well as icon design that
  will inspire your customers to continue reading, and to be repeat customers. The only thing
  that matters in this world is family and friends. Here in Wisconsin, we are world renowned
  for three things....The Green Bay Packers, cheese, and cows. Some people might get offended
  if you referred to them as a cheesehead. Not me. I always say, "I have been called a lot worse!"
